This week I worked on the FSR, ICD, Schedule and Validation Plan.
I finalized the programming language for the FPGA. Verilog is the chosen language.
I am now working to complete the introduction subsystem project, and set up and familiarize myself with the Altium
software.
My personal plan is to finish the introduction project.
