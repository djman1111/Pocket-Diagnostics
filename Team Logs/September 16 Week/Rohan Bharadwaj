This week I worked on the ConOps Report executive summary, system description, and modes of operation sections.
I received information regarding Altium access from the professor.
I met with the professor to discuss the subsystems and finalize them.
It was told that the electronics subsytem would need to be revamped to make sure that technical merit is met
appropriately.
I am now working to revamp the electronics subsystem, and set up and familiarize myself with the Altium
software.
My personal plan is to finalize the electronics subsystem by the end of this week.
