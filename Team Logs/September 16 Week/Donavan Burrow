This is my report for the week of sept 16th
I contacted John Lusher, our sponsor, last weekend to clarify the requirement on IOS/Android compatibility.
I am now required to have the app capable of being used on Android and IOS. I then created a Flutterflow account
by the recomendation of our sponsor to create the app.
