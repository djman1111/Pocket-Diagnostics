The past week I soldered on the major components to the PCB for testing.
A major issue that arose is that the ADC converter footprint was incorrect, I had configured it to the bottom view.
To fix this I need to redesign and order a new PCB board. I plan to get the board ordered by the end of the week. 
The plan for next week is to assemble redesigned board, get FPGA tested.
